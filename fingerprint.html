    Internet is a cooperative public data network that is commonly used throughout the world. The internet consist of a system where data traffic<br>
    flows around freely and is transported by a variety of carriers. As technology advanced, the internet has grown and become a resource where<br>
    business is performed or managed, as well as many other activities. Unfortunately, many of the cyber versions of these activities are insecure<br>
    and does not guarantee privacy, which can potentially turn into a difficult issue. In attempt to strengthen a users security and privacy, a large<br>
    amount of internet users switched from what was once known as a http to a more advanced version, https (where the s stands for secure).<br>
    <br>
    The main difference between the two is that https connections are encrypted by technology which is unknown, meaning this connection is nearly<br>
    impposible to break. The primary purposes for a https connection are to enhance a users privacy and security, and secure communications between<br>
    users. In other words, https is http with encryption and verification, this shows that https is the better option when given the choice. After the<br>
    creation of https, network traffic monitoring and filtering started losing vision due to the strong encryption of the https connection. In response<br>
    to this loss of vision, organizations developed new technology known as Https proxy appliances, which is a device that takes away users guarantee<br>
    of internet browser privacy and security.<br>
    <br>
    A MITM is a cyber attack which intercepts communication between two parties causing a risk of the attacker stealing personal information, corrupt <br>
    data, etc. A hash is a complex mathmatical algorithm that carefully processes data. The CA, also known as certificate authorities, are the third party<br>
    who prove their identity and assure users that their information is safe and secure by digitally signing a certificate. An SSL interception cannot<br>
    be prevented, however it can be reliably detected because it is not possible to spoof any security certificate. A false positive and a false <br>
    negative are both test results that determines whethere a certain condition is present or absent. A false positive incorrectly indicates that a condition <br>
    is present while a false negative incorrectly indicates that a condition is absent. Yes ISP can eavesdrop on your communications, but that can be prevented<br>
    by using VPN. <br>
