    Sentient AI will lead to a Utopia for humans, possibly improving our world to an unimaginable extent. The dreams of ai researchers will finally come true, and society will
    enter its finest form of artificial intelligence. AI has already achieved such a unique level that would leave many people impressed of its accomplishments. A.I. researc
    hers have begun referring to the past decade as a golden age of progress in artificial intelligence. In other words, an efficient wave of progress in many ares of A.I.
    research.<br>
    <br>
    Just a few years ago, A.I. was progressing at a slow and steady pace while different areas in A.I. struggled with certain features, such as rudimentary conversations.
    Unlike before, A.I. has advanced to a high extent and developed a variety of features. For example, OpenAis GPT-3 is a large language model used to write screenplays,
    compose marketing emails, develop video games, and etc. Not only has A.I. increased its features, but it has even beat humans in areas, such as language and reasoning.
    In the past, A.I. progress was mainly visibile only by insiders who read the latest research papers or attended the conference presentations. Despite this, the progress
    of A.I. has began being more noticible even by people who take no interest in A.I. research. Obviously, there are still broken A.I. out there, but the best A.I. systems
    are now more reliable and capable.<br>
    <br>
    Although, there are many risks and problems that can occur due to A.I., A.I.s potential in the future would be far greater than one could imagine. The continuation
    of improving A.I. would assure a promising future with little to no regrets. Which is why this is the time to start working towards A.I.s potential regardless of the
    risks.
